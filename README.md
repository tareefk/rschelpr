# rsconnect-email-helper
Simple R package to simplify writing emails for Connect.  This package wraps many of the settings exposed in the [RStudio Connect User's guide section on email customization](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/r-markdown.html#r-markdown-email-customization) and makes it a little less error prone.  

# Install

This package is not going to go to CRAN. If you would like to install it:

```
